## The longer story:

I'm Maciek, UI engineer with 16 years of experience. I started my professional journey in 2006 by building small websites by myself, including design, backend (own CMS), and frontend parts. Since then, I graduated from a technical university (MSc. in computer science), where I was an official Mozilla Campus Rep. Around 2009, I decided to focus more on frontend parts of the web projects, and I mastered Photoshop designs to html+css conversion. I used my skills for delivering projects for various digital agencies in Poland, UK & Norway. While time was going by, I've been discovering and using new tools, trying to always be up to date with the modern web. People from my teams started seeing that one of my two most significant strengths is communication with the designers and creativity in implementation; thus, I've been often invited to work on a project before the implementation phase started. In 2014, I got back for a part-time at my uni, where I've been teaching frontend on post-graduate studies for three years. In 2015 I started attending conferences as a speaker and organizer. I'm a member of the program council of the biggest developers conference (4developers) in Poland, responsible for JavaScript & Frontend / UI tracks. In 2019 I started WTF (What the frontend?!) - my online frontend school with 1900+ students. I'm teaching people the basics of the web, focusing on essential parts: layers of the website, semantics, proper usage of CSS properties, and programming concepts with JS (without the frameworks). I believe that it's crucial for the current and next generation of developers to know the basics - without that, the digital products they're creating will lose their potential. 

My motto is that frontend is an art. I even wrote a song about this and presented it live on the stage of one of the conferences: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjCOad_9d-g

The professional goal of mine is to make the web accessible & beautiful.
